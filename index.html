    <h1>こんにちはサ-プ? This is cringe but I'm just a placeholder!</h1>
    <p>Test! I am being tested on! Look at me and admire my looks! This website is meant to be a sample anime/manga
        themed website! For me, it's just practicing my own web design skills (and a little bit of web development).
        Enjoy!</p>
    <p>The best manga currently is「ダンダダン」! If you're into chaotic/weird/teenage
        romance/aliens/yokai/whatever, it's the manga for you! Go read it! NOW!</p>
